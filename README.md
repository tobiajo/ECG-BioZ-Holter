# ECG/BioZ Holter (c) by Tobias Johansson

Design and development of a pocket-sized ECG device with respiration monitoring, accelerometer and gyroscope. The produced prototype transmits sampled data with a MCU (PIC24) over Bluetooth to an Android device for which a simple app was developed. To achieve the objective; a system solution was engineered, components chose, PCB designed, soldering done and sub devices configured or programmed.

## Main components

- Texas Instruments ADS1292R
- InvenSense MPU-6050
- Microchip PIC24FJ64GA002
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
